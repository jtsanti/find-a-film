# find-a-film
This app has two modes:

## Random Movie Game
Select a movie genre and a random movie from that genre will appear. You can then choose to like or dislike the movie, and a new movie will then display. Likes and dislikes are tallied at the top of the screen.


## Film Searcher
This will allow you to search for a movie and find where you can watch it online.

This is an extension of a mini-project I started through Codecademy's frontend program.
